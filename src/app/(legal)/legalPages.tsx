        <p>
          This policy describes how ShapeUp handles account, payment, image, 3D asset, AI-processing, cookie,
          retention, and deletion data.
        </p>
        <h2>Information We Process</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Account data from Clerk, such as login identifiers and authentication metadata.</li>
          <li>Payment workflow data handled by Stripe. ShapeUp does not store full card numbers.</li>
          <li>Face photos, scan metadata, PLY files, and SPLAT files stored in AWS S3 for the haircut visualization workflow.</li>
          <li>Hair-edit prompts and structured profile/parameter data sent to Google Gemini for AI edit and barber-spec generation.</li>
          <li>Essential cookies or similar technologies needed for authentication, security, payments, and app operation.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>AI Processing</h2>
        <p>
          ShapeUp currently sends edit-loop and barber-summary prompts to Google Gemini. Gemini&apos;s data use,
          retention, and opt-out terms apply to this processing.
        </p>
        <h2>Retention And Deletion</h2>
        <p>
          We retain account records while the account is active; scan images and derived assets until the user
          deletes the account/data; and payment and security logs as required by law and fraud-prevention needs.
        </p>
        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>
          Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, export, correct, delete, or restrict processing of
          personal information. Use <Link href="/delete-my-data">Delete my data</Link> or contact us at{' '}

        <h2>Accounts, Credits, And Payments</h2>

          Users are responsible for account security. Paid credits are processed through Stripe and used for AI/ML
          generation workflows. Refunds are handled on a case-by-case basis; contact us to request a refund.
        </p>
        <h2>Acceptable Use</h2>
        <p>

          do not have rights or consent to use.
        </p>
        <h2>Disclaimers And Liability</h2>

        <p>
          ShapeUp currently uses essential technologies for authentication, security, payments, and app operation. No
          non-essential analytics cookie banner was added because no non-essential analytics/tracking integration was
          found in source during this pass.
        </p>
        <h2>Essential Technologies</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Clerk authentication session cookies or tokens.</li>
          <li>Stripe checkout/payment security flows.</li>
          <li>Convex real-time connection state needed for the app.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Future Non-Essential Tracking</h2>
        <p>
          If analytics, ads, or non-essential tracking are added later, ShapeUp will add an opt-in consent mechanism
          before those tools run.

    updated: '2026-06-08',

        <p>
          ShapeUp processes face photos and derived 3D meshes such as PLY and SPLAT files to generate virtual haircut
          previews. These may be considered biometric identifiers or biometric information in some jurisdictions.
        </p>
        <h2>Purpose</h2>
        <p>
          We use face photos and derived geometry only to create, store, render, and refine your haircut visualization.
        </p>
        <h2>Consent</h2>
        <p>
          Before the first scan or upload, ShapeUp asks for explicit opt-in consent and records that consent in Convex.
          Upload and FaceLift processing routes reject requests when consent is not recorded.
        </p>
        <h2>Retention And Destruction</h2>
        <p>
          We delete face photos, PLY files, SPLAT files, scan sessions, and project assets when you request deletion
          or after two years, whichever occurs first, unless law requires a different period.
        </p>
        <h2>No Sale Of Biometric Data</h2>
        <p>ShapeUp does not sell biometric data.</p>
        <h2>Delete Your Data</h2>
        <p>
          You can request deletion at <Link href="/delete-my-data">Delete my data</Link>.
